Binary and multiclass perceptron on some preset test and training data:
  - Run program.py, set binary_perceptron to TRUE for binary implementation or FALSE for multi classification
  
Problem was to implement it for preset test and training data
 - TO DO: Make test/train dynamic and use k-fold validation
